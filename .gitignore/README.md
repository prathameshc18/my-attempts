I'm an Indian student who has just passed out of college, and is looking forward to learn game designing. I'm starting from scratch, and hence my work may look unprofessional, but bear it for awhile as it's only going to get better with time. Learning every bit from online youtube tutorials and web articles. I have always been keen about gaming. It has been a childhood dream of mine to work at Rockstar games someday. So giving it my honest try. Right now, I'm self learning, with no professional guidance, hence if you have anything criticize about, please let me know about it so that I can work on it and try to learn about the things I am missing out on.
